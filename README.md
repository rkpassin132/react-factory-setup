- Pre-built Services: Essential services already implemented, including:
  - Local Storage Management: For handling authentication tokens.
  - HTTP Service with Token Integration: API calls with automatic token injection.
  - Auth service for login signup and logout
- Use Interface to enhance code type safety, quality, maintainability, and developer experience.
